//Java : toString() method - 1 bookmark_border

//A BankAccount class is defined as below: -
//
//class BankAccount {
//    private String name;
//    private double balance;
//
//    // your code goes here
//}
//add the following method to it:
//
//public String toString()
//Your method should return a string that contains the account's name and balance separated by a comma and space. For example, if an account object named acc1 has the name "Amit" and a balance of 120.4, the call of acc1.toString() should return:
//
//Amit, 120.4
//There are some special cases you should handle. If the balance is negative, put the message as below. Also, always display the paise as a one-digit number. For example, if the same object had a balance of -17.5, your method should return:
//
//Amit, -17.5 (NEGATIVE)
